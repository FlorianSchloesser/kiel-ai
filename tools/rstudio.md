# RStudio

RStudio is a development environment which was originally developed for R, but is more and more moving into a development environment for other programming languages like Python as well. It is therefore a perfect environment for a smooth transition between the two languages.

While R is currently the programming language with the best libraries to do inference statistical analyses and to generate perfectly designed reports and other types of documents, Python is currently the programming language with the best libraries for machine learning and the integration of statistical modells into a production envirenment for any type of application.
