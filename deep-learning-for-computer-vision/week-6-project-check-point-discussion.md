# Week 6 - Detection Algorithms

## This week you will..

* Discuss the car detection algorithms
* Think about other detection/localization applications

## Learning Resources

## Until next week you should

* Prepare a small presentation about the state of your project.&#x20;
* Finish the homework about [Image Segmentation using U-Net](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/programming/omqTR/image-segmentation-with-u-net)

#### The presentation should contain:

* goal of the project
* state of the art (was it already done? If yes, how? If no, why?)
* your approach
* your dataset
* your problems (if any :D )
