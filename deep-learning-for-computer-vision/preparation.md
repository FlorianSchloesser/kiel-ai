* the Coursera platform and the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

What would be very beneficial for this course (but not mandatory, you will learn it anyway during the course):

* knowledge of [numpy](https://numpy.org) and [opencv python](https://opencv.org/course-opencv-python/) packages
* knowing how to work with images in python
* knowing what a convolution is
