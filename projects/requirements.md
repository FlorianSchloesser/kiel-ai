# How to Start and Submit



**In order to receive ECTS** for a course you have to **complete a machine learning project in a team** with a maximum of 4 participants and miss less than 2 sessions of the course.

Unless your course instructor explicitly advises you differently, you must document and submit your project using the general project template repository.

## **Always** start your project as follows:

1. **Navigate to the Template Repository**
2.  **Use this Template**: Above the file list, click the "Use this template" button.

    ![Use this template button](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/use-this-template-button.png)
3. **Create Repository from Template**: You'll be prompted to name your new repository and you can choose whether it should be public or private. You'll also have the option to include all branches in the template repository, if there are more than one.
4. **Create Repository**: Click "Create repository from template" to create the new repository.
5. **Clone the New Repository**: You can now clone the new repository to your local machine using `git clone` and start working on your project.



The requirements are:

1. The Code, which should include
   * the python code (notebook .ipynb or .py are accepted)
   * comments to make the code clear and readable
   * the definition of the environment (dependencies)
   * text explaining the project divided in sections (Introduction, Data and Methods, Results, Baseline)
2. The project has to be presented in class during the last sessions. \
   This can be done during the class or a short video can be recorded. For example, a screen recording of the notebook with an explanation of the project, the code and the results would work.\
   The length of the presentation and/or the video will be discussed in each course, it usually is around 15 minutes.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you do not specify anything, we will release the code in our repository alongside with the other projects. If you want, you can add a statement that the code is released as open source software and a license which explains how the code can be re-used. \
The data you use in your project can remain private if you wish.
{% endhint %}

Details about the requirements of the project will also be discussed in the course.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please ask your course instructor if something is unclear, preferably **before** you start the project.
