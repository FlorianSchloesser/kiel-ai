# Coursera

Coursera is a huge platform which offers thousands of online course.&#x20;

{% embed url="https://www.coursera.org" %}

In our program (in many courses, not in all of them) we make use of the idea of blended learning, that means we combine online courses with a personal part with a teacher.&#x20;

Through Opencampus each Student will get a license to participate in a course and each Student can follow the course and make the assignment on the Coursera platform and get the corresponding Certificate at the end of the course.

Assignment will be discussed in class and questions will be answered. However, we are not allowed to provide the full solution to each assignment, just to help you to manage it.
