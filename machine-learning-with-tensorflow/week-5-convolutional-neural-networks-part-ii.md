# Week 5 - Convolutional Neural Networks, Part II

### This week you will...

* get familiar wit transfer learning, a powerful technique to include the knowledge of models that were trained on large datasets and benefit from the features these models already learned in your own problem scenario.
* move beyond binary classification into categorical classification and the specific coding considerations for the corresponding models.
* decide on the final project you would like to work on.

### Learning Resources

* Week 3 and 4 of the course [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow)

### Until next week you should...

* complete week 1 and week 2 of the course [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow), including the provided assignments
* meet with your team members for your project and talk about first steps.
