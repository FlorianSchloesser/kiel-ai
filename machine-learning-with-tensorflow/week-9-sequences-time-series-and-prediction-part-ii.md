# Week 9 - Sequences, Time Series and Prediction, Part II

### This week you will...

* explore using Recurrent Neural networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and see how useful they are to classify and predict on sequential data.
* add CNNs on top of Dnns and RNNs and put it together using a real world data series -- one which measures sunspot activity over hundreds of years,

### Learning Resources

* Week 3 and 4 of the course [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction)

### Until next week you should...

* define a baseline model for the your project
* focus fully on your project work to advance for the final presentation
