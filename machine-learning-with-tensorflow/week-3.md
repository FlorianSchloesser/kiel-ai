# Week 3 - Introduction to TensorFlow,Part II

### This week you will...

* see how to improve the basic neural network for computer vision you learned last week.
* learn about what happens if your data is more complex; if the images are larger, or if the features are not always in the same place, and how to handle such issues.

### Learning Resources

* Week 3 and 4 of the course [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/)

### Until next week you should...

* complete week 1 and week 2 of the course [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow), including the provided assignments
* post a concrete project idea in the course channel of the chat.
