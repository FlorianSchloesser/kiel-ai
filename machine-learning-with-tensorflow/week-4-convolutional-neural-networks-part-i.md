# Week 4 - Convolutional Neural Networks, Part I

### This week you will...

* go deeper into using ConvNets with real-world data and a much larger dataset than those you've been using thus far.
* learn about image augmentation, a technique to avoid overfitting by tweaking the training set to potentially increase the diversity of subjects it covers.
* discuss your project ideas.

### Learning Resources

* Week 1 and 2 of the course [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow)

### Until next week you should...

* complete week 3 and week 4 of the course [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow), including the provided assignments.
* do a literature review considering deep learning approaches that deal with a problem similar to yours:
  * Which are the models commonly used for my problem?
  * Which format must the training data have?
  * How much training data is typically used in similar problems?
  * Are there pretrained models I can use for my problem?
