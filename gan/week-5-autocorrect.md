# Week 6 - Autocorrect

Welcome to second course and to Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models! Congratulations that you have made it that far! :slight\_smile:&#x20;

Let us start with some words on what probalistic models are. These are models that are based on the principle: "given these words what is the most likely next word". So a pretty reasonable approach :slight\_smile:&#x20;

In this week we learn about autocorrect, minimum edit distance, and dynamic programming. At the end we build your own spellchecker to correct misspelled words!&#x20;
