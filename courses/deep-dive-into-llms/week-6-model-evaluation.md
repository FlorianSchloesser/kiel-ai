# Week 6 - Model Evaluation

### This week you will...

* get to know Weights & Biases a popular platform to evaluate deep learning models.
* understand different evaluation metrics.
* get a high level introduction into training LLMs.

### Learning Resources

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/231127_Model Evaluation.pdf" %}

* [short course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/evaluating-debugging-generative-ai/) by Deeplearning.AI and Weights & Biases on how to use the Weights & Biases framework to track and evaluate your model results

### Until next week you should...

* [x] watch [this video](https://youtu.be/-RPeakdlHYo) on data collators.
* [x] work through the section [Training a causal language model from scratch](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter7/6) from the Hugging Face NLP course (do not change to the TensorFlow version of the site).
* [x] Decide on a baseline model and add a short description of your approach in the corresponding section of your project repository.
