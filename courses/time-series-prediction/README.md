# Time Series Prediction

We start with a short introduction of the course topics. Get to know each other and the other participants and explain the course structure and all the required tasks for a successful participation.

This requires i.e.: Give a project presentation and provide a well documented code with data via GitHub. Addtionally you are only allowed to miss two class sessions during the semester.

Please enroll/attend/complete to the following Coursera MOOCs during the semester:

Some additional course material and MOOCs if you want you expand your knowledge at your own pace:

{% embed url="https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-time-series-analysis" %}
This is a nice time series course with a focus on R/RStudio. It goes slightly deeper then our first course but lacks machine learning techniques. Nevertheless a very good ranked course and worth doing it - if you like to deepen your knowledge.&#x20;

This book is freely available and provides additional information. Focus on R/RStudio.

For the semester project - you can bring your own data - we will discuss this in the first/second session. Nevertheless here you can find some resources to think about a potential project:

Last but not least - we would like to mention some very good book references. It is not required or requested to buy any of these books. If you are enrolled as a student at CAU, FH Kiel or another university you might have access to these books via the SpringerLink of your home institution. They cover the course material quite well and provide GitHub-Repositories for the codes which where used throughout the book. Unfortunately there is no 1:1-Coursera course matching these books perfectly - but we will do our best ;-)
