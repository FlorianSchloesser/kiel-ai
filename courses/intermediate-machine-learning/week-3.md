The main objective of this competition is to develop a machine or deep learning-based model to classify the given paddy leaf images accurately. We provide a training dataset of 10,407 (75%) labeled images across ten classes (nine disease categories and normal leaf). Moreover, we also provide additional metadata for each image, such as the paddy variety and age. Your task is to classify each paddy image in the given test dataset of 3,469 (25%) images into one of the nine disease categories or a normal leaf.
