!!!

Using all techniques learned build the best model you can to achieve an accury at least above 70%. You can use Transfer Learning, Augmentation and other tricks. You can also take inspiration from fellow notebooks on Kaggle. Good ideas will be rewarded by special achievement badges for the course. Have fun and push the accuracy!ðŸ˜Š
