# Week 8 - Presentation of the Final Projects

### This week you will...

* present your project in the final presentation. :-)

The presentation should take about 15 minutes and include the following aspects that correspond to the content of a model card for the Hugging Face library:

* model description
* intended uses & limitations
* training data
* training procedure
* variable and Metrics
* evaluation results

Check this section on [Building a model card](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter4/4) for more details.

Additionally, please also include into your presentation any things that you tried out and that didn't work, so we can all learn from your experiences.
