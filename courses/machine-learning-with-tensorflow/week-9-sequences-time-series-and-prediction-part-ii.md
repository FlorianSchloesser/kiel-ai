# Week 9 - Sequences, Time Series and Prediction, Part II

### This week you will...

- explore using Recurrent Neural networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and see how useful they are to classify and predict on sequential data.
- add CNNs on top of Dnns and RNNs and put it together using a real world data series -- one which measures sunspot activity over hundreds of years,
