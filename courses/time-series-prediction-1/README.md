# Advanced Time Series Prediction

Welcome to all participants.

We start with a short introduction of the course topics. Get to know each other and explain the course structure and all the required tasks for a successful participation.

This requires i.e.: Give a project presentation and provide a well documented code with data via GitHub. Addtionally you are only allowed to miss two class sessions during the semester.
