### Homework

1. Watch the course “[Large Language Models with Semantic Search](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/large-language-models-semantic-search)”
2. Prepare a short presentation (max 5 min per group) with 2 parts:

* Present your project outline using the template (or improvise)
* Present a rough prototype (or mockup) using LangFlow



Use one of the available no-code tools (or, if you prefer, LangChain) to test the feasibility of your idea by creating a first small prototype.
