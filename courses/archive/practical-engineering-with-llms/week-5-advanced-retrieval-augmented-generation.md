### Homework for next week

* Watch the course “[Building Generative AI Applications with Gradio](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/huggingface-gradio)”
* Install Gradio and explore the examples from the Gradio playground locally ([https://www.gradio.app/playground](https://www.gradio.app/playground))
* Think about the elements your application user interface should contain, create a sketch or wireframe of your app and implement it with Gradio
* (If possible connect your prototype to the user interface)
