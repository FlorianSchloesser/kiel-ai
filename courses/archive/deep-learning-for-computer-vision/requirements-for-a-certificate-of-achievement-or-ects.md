#### Attendance:

{% hint style="danger" %}
We register automatically the attendance.&#x20;

When you join the Zoom Session, please use **the same name** you have in the edu.opencampus.sh platform. You can change your name in the edu.opencampus.sh platform (click at the top-right on your profile photo) and in Zoom (click at the top-right of your video stream), so you should be able to use the same name during the weekly session.

If _for any reason (no need to explain)_ you do not want to use the same name, but still need to be registered, please contact me **at the beginning of the course.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Projects:

Check the Projects section to learn more about the projects.

#### Coursera:

Each weekly session is complemented with the videos and homework from the Coursera courses.\
Going through the video and doing the assignment allows you to learn and understand each session, so it is required for the course.

However, Coursera is indipendent from us and the completion of the Coursera assignment is NOT needed for the Opencampus Certificate. \
Completing all assignment will give you the Coursera Certificates (which is different)
