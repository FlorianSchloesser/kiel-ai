# TELeR: A General Taxonomy of LLM Prompts for Benchmarking Complex Tasks

In one interesting paper the authors emphasize the importance of a standardized taxonomy for LLM prompts targeted towards solving complex tasks and, subsequently, provide such a taxonomy, i.e., TELeR, which can be utilized by multiple independent researchers who are conducting such research studies in order to report their results using a single unified standard.&#x20;

As developers we can look at the best level (i.e. level 6) and use all the listed promt details for our prompts we design for our task.
