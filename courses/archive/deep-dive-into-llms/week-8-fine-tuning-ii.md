# Week 8 - Fine-Tuning II and Model Inference

### This week you will...

* explore advanced training techniques designed to train large models efficiently, minimizing computational requirements.
* gain comprehensive insights into the key hyperparameters for effective model inference.
* discover the unique attributes of inference processes for streaming Large Language Models (LLMs).
