# Week 8 - Machine Learning Strategy 1 & 2

### This week you will..

* Guidelines for the projects presentations, suggestions on what to put on them, baseline and human performances.&#x20;
* Talk about how to structure the training, test and validation set, and more general on how to structure the whole project.&#x20;
* What about using transfer learning, end-to-end approaches, divide the problem into smaller subproblems, or using multi-tasking? Sometimes the problem can be seen from another perspective.&#x20;
* Since there were no programming assignment for this week, walkthrough an LSTM tutorial on time series.
