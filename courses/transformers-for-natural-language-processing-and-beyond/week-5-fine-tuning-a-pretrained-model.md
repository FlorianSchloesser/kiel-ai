# Week 5 - Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Model

### This week you will...

* learn how to fine-tune a Hugging Face model with your own data
* get a first intuition on the self-attention mechanism

### Until next class you should...

* [x] watch [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTUuEx3GkA\&list=PL75e0qA87dlG-za8eLI6t0\_Pbxafk-cxb\&index=9) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIvKXrEDMhk\&list=PL75e0qA87dlG-za8eLI6t0\_Pbxafk-cxb\&index=10) of the Rasa Series on Attention & Transformers
* [x] complete at least one of the sections of [chapter 7 of the Huging Face course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/1?fw=pt) (choose according to your project goal)
* [x] get an individual meeting with the tutor to fix the project goal
* [x] prepare the following parts of your project to present them in a short peer review:
  1. Review of comparable problems and solutions
  2. Review dataset characteristics (bias/ limitations?)
  3. Decide on a baseline
  4. Decide on a model evaluation metric
