Object Oriented Programming is not an easy concept. The video is almost three hours long!

For the best learning experience, it's recommended to watch the lecture twice: first for a quick overview, and then more slowly while taking notes. Please ensure you allocate sufficient time for this.

* **Work through the following homework assignment (short)**

Always first create a copy with "Copy to Drive" or download the notebooks to work locally on them. Otherwise your progress won't be saved.
