# Week 2 - Prompt Engineering

#### Session Content

* Quiz
* Homework presentation
* Short recap on intro to LLMs & prompt engineering
* Breakout session on prompt hubs
* Anatomy of an app
* Breakout session on project ideas
* Presentation of project ideas and default projects
* Homework for next week

#### Todo until next session

* Watch the short course ["LangChain for LLM Application Development"](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain) (\~1h 40min)
* If the videos ["Question and Answer"](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/lesson/5/question-and-answer) and ["Evaluation"](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/lesson/6/evaluation) are too confusing for you right now, as they introduce a lot of concepts in a short amount of time, you can skip these videos as this content will also be part of later sessions.
* Work through the Jupyter notebook ["HomeworkLangChain"](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XcJ2VyTnxxk\_1fngRXcHSg6YJq39bjnm?usp=sharing) and complete the tasks at the bottom of the notebook.
