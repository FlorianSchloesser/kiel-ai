# Prototyping Week

{% embed url="https://starterkitchen.de/ptw/" %}

The prototyping week is a great opportunity to explore your ideas or find new ones. The basic idea is to go in one week from just an idea in the back of your head to a concept/product/service/business.&#x20;

It brings together people from different backgrounds and perspective to help structuring together a better project.

For your opencampus.sh Machine Learning Degree you have to complete the Prototyping Week and pursue a project whose realization includes the implementation of an AI application.
