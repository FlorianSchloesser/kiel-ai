# KI.EL Racing Challenge

### **Contact**

Jake Petersen, opencampus.sh

### Description

Together we want to build, code and race a Self-Driving Car equipped with an NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

### Dataset

We generate the training data by driving the car via a manual remote control.

### How you can contribute

We are looking forward to participants having very limited coding experience to having already experience in programming machine learning models to complete the track in the shortest amount of time.
