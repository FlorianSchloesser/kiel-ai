# AI and Art

### Description

Instead of increasing efficiency through machine learning and doing predictive analytics, we let AI, for example, write poems in the style of Kurt Schwitters and perform them by AI-generated jazz musicians. We can use AI to create previously non-existent people, art movements, and dream sequences, or short films made entirely by AI (script, video, music, and actors).

### Dataset

Your memories and fantasies. :-)

### How you can contribute

We look forward to participants who are interested in combining artificial intelligence and creativity.
