# Text Classification Using Prompt Design

### Contact

Christian Mayer, University of Mannheim

### Description

In learning contexts it is crucial to provide fast feedback to the learner. Therefore, as a first step, we will categorize open text responses provided on complex problem solving tasks according to the quality and correctness of the arguments used. Later we want to use these to automatically provide appropriate feedback.

### Dataset

About 1,800 open text responses from students.&#x20;

### How you can contribute

We are happy for anyone to join our project. You should have a strong interest in how to automate the scoring or classification of open-ended text responses. Basic programming knowledge would be good. You are also welcome to use our data for a fine-tuning approach to the classification.
